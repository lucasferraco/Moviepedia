# Moviepedia - Desafio Mobile ArcTouch

#### Build & Run
To build the project, you have to:

* Download the ZIP file or clone the repo on a Mac;
  * If you go for the ZIP, unzip it;
* Open Viajabessa.xcodeproj on the "Moviepedia" folder with Xcode 9;
* Pick a simulator (best with iPhones, but work on iPads) and;
* Run the project (CMD+R).

P.S.: it's also possible to run the project on a physical device, you just have to connect it on a Mac, 
pick it on Xcode and run, but **it's necessary to have a paid Apple developer account** and
register it on the project team (Targets > Moviepedia > General > Signing > Team).

#### Third-party Libraries
I've only used one (1) external library that is **Alamofire**.
I used as my network layer to fecth data, including images, from the TMDb API.
